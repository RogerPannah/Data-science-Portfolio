[**PROJECT 2** :Project: E-News Express Data Analysis](https://github.com/RogerPannah/Data-science-Portfolio/blob/main/E_News_Express_project.ipynb)

Introduction
This project analyzes user interaction data from E-News Express, an online news platform. By leveraging business statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the goal is to uncover insights about user behavior, evaluate the performance of control and treatment groups, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance user engagement and conversion rates.

Summary of Key Points
* Problem Statement: Analyze the effectiveness of a new landing page (treatment group) compared to the current page (control group) in improving user engagement and conversions.

Tools Used:
* Data Manipulation: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Objectives and Outcomes:
* Objective: Determine if the new landing page increases time spent on the page and conversions.
* Outcome: The treatment group showed higher time spent on the page and improved conversions compared to the control group, validating the effectiveness of the new landing page.
* Objective: Explore trends and patterns based on user preferences (e.g., language and group behavior).
* Outcome: Identified English-speaking users as the most engaged, with language preference impacting conversion rates.
* Objective: Assess and validate statistical significance between control and treatment groups.
* Outcome: Statistical tests confirmed that the differences in engagement and conversions between the groups were significant.

[**PROJECT** 3:Medicon Case Study:statistics](https://github.com/RogerPannah/Data-science-Portfolio/blob/main/Copy_of_Inferential_Statistics_Medicon_Project.ipynb)

This project focuses on analyzing the quality and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical vaccine batch. The Medicon team clinically tested five batches of their COVID-19 vaccine, with the sixth batch undergoing quality assurance testing. The study evaluates the following:

Objectives:
* Quality Analysis: Evaluate the probability distribution of satisfactory and unsatisfactory doses for small samples.
* City Supply Assurance: Predict the likelihood of satisfactory doses in a batch provided to healthcare workers.
* Time of Effect Analysis: Analyze the distribution of the vaccine's effect duration using real-world sample data.

Key Features:
* Probability-based modeling of vaccine effectiveness.
* Statistical distribution visualizations and analysis.
* Calculation of probabilities for specific dose quality scenarios.
* Percentile and effectiveness analysis for time-based data.

Tools and Technologies:
* Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy.
* Statistics: Inferential statistics for probability distributions.
* Data Analysis: Real-world datasets for effectiveness time evaluation.

Skills:
Data analysis, statistical modeling, Python programming, and visualization expertise.

[**PROJECT**:4:Talent Hunt Examination Case Study](https://github.com/RogerPannah/Data-science-Portfolio/blob/main/Talent_Hunt_Examination_Case_Study_Estimation_and_Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb)

Talent Hunt Examination Case Study

This project investigates the performance metrics from a Talent Hunt Examination dataset, evaluating claims and providing statistical insights. The analysis includes confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing to verify score distributions across subjects.

Key Objectives:
* Construct 95% confidence intervals for average scores in Computer Science, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics.
* Test a critic‚Äôs claim that average scores in Physics and Mathematics are below a cutoff of 82 using one-tailed Z-tests.
* Validate an investor‚Äôs claim that Chemistry and Computer Science scores exceed a cutoff of 85 using one-tailed Z-tests.

Statistical Insights:
Z-test statistics and p-values:
* Physics: Z = -2.35, p = 0.0094 (Reject null hypothesis; average score < 82).
* Mathematics: Z = -3.45, p = 0.0003 (Reject null hypothesis; average score < 82).
* Chemistry: Z = 2.11, p = 0.0174 (Fail to reject null hypothesis; average score ‚â• 85).
* Computer Science: Z = 2.87, p = 0.0021 (Reject null hypothesis; average score > 85).
* These results validate the critic‚Äôs claim for Physics and Mathematics and partially support the investor‚Äôs claims for Chemistry and Computer Science.

Key Skills Applied:
* Statistical Analysis: Confidence intervals, Z-tests, and p-value interpretation.
* Data Visualization: Representing distributions and results using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Data Wrangling: Preparing, cleaning, and processing data with pandas and NumPy.
* Hypothesis Testing: Formulating and testing null and alternative hypotheses using rigorous statistical methods.
* Programming: Utilizing Python for automated data analysis and reproducibility.

Outcomes: This analysis provides a comprehensive statistical validation of performance claims and helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions. It showcases proficiency in business statistics, hypothesis testing, and data storytelling.

Usage: Insights from the study can be used to enhance the institute's marketing strategies, refine preparatory programs, and assure stakeholders of the program's quality.
